Dressing sense means how you present yourself to people in terms of dressing n looks ..

the one is having good dressing sense would wear in which he/she looks good and feel comfortable.. what suits him/her apart from copy anything

bad dressing sense is when a person is wearing clothes which actually doesn't suits him/her but they are wearing it because they have seen it on others or just liked the dress.. the one who don't care if the clothes suits his/her personalty or not

dressing sense is not something to go wd the trend its about the wear which gives you better appearance and defines you better
